## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I Learned

This project helped me solidify my understanding of responsive design using media queries and Flexbox. Below is an example of how I used media queries to adjust the layout for mobile devices:

```css
@media (max-width: 576px) {
    .perfume-container {
        flex-direction: column;
        width: 300px;
        align-items: center;
    }

    .perfume-image {
        width: 100%;
        height: auto;
    }

    .info-card {
        text-align: center;
    }
}
```

### Continued Development

I plan to continue improving my skills in responsive design and explore more advanced CSS techniques like Grid layout. Additionally, I aim to learn more about accessibility and ensure my projects are usable for all users.
